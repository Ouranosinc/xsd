Welcome to Xsd's documentation!
===============================

`Xsd` is a toolkit for statistical downscaling usising Xarray_. It is meant to
support the development of new and existing downscaling methods in a common
framework. It implements a fit/predict API that accepts Xarray objects,
similiar to Python's Scikit-Learn_, for building a range of statitical
downscaling models.

Under Active Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Xsd is under active development. We are looking for additional contributors
to help fill out the list of downscaling methods supported here. We are also
looking to find collaborators interested in using deep learning to build
global downscaling tools. Get in touch with us on our
`GitHub page <https://github.com/jhamman/xsd>`_.
